FilmCritBanner
==============

A [Vicarious][1] client that pulls tweets from [@FilmCritHULK][2] and republishes them in a less... aggressive manner as [@FilmCritBanner][3].

Usage
-----

### Configuration ###

Because FilmCritBanner uses Vicarious (and by extension [Twitter4J][4]), it depends on a `twitter4J.properties` file that contains the Twitter API keys, access tokens, etc. If you want to fork this project and use it on your own, you will need to supply these keys for an account that you control. More information on the various ways to configure Twitter4J can be found [here][5].


Build
-----

FilmCritBanner is built with [Maven][6]. To build the project and install it in your local Maven repositiory, type:

	mvn install

To execute a single debug run of FilmCritBanner from Maven, type:

	mvn exec:java
	
As a more stable/portable solution, you can also use `film-crit-banner-shaded.jar` artifact generated by Maven:

	java -jar film-crit-banner-shaded.jar
